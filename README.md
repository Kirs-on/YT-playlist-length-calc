### Description:

This simple program calculates the total length (duration) of yt playlist. It takes an yt url either from /watch page of video in playlist or /playlist page. Using google youtube API it calulates the length of entire playlist. It also checks how many videos are available for user, so if some videos in playlist are private or location restricted it will only give back the number of videos available to watch and their total duration. 
This python script uses google api key so it is necessary to have a google developer account and a dedicated app with an API key generated to youtube API created in developers dashoboard. The process of creating a google developer account and obtaining a API key is also shown in video demo.
